# FAQ

## What is Salto?

Salto allows you to manage your business applications' configuration in code. By doing so, it enables modern devops style methodologies for development, testing and deployment for these business applications.

Salto consists of 3 main components:

1. The NaCl configuration language — a declarative configuration language (based on [hcl](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/tree/hcl2)), specifically designed to describe the configuration of modern business applications.
2. The Salto command line interface — a tool which uses NaCl files to manage the configuration of business applications, with operations such as `deploy` (to deploy configuration changes to a bizapp) and `fetch` (to fetch the latest state of a business application into NaCl files). This tool is composed of a core processing engine, and various adapters to interact with the different bizapps.
3. The Salto vs-code extension — An extension to the popular vs-code IDE to easily interact with NaCl files.

## Which services are supported?

Currently, Salto supports the following services:

- [Salesforce](https://github.com/salto-io/salto/tree/master/packages/salesforce-adapter)
- [NetSuite](https://github.com/salto-io/salto/tree/master/packages/netsuite-adapter)
- [HubSpot](https://github.com/salto-io/salto/tree/master/packages/hubspot-adapter)

Support for other services is in the works.

## How should I manage my service credentials?

Currently, service credentials are stored under your $SALTO_HOME directory (e.g. $HOME/.salto on MacOS), in the directory corresponding to the relevant workspace. We choose to store the credentials there by default in order to reduce the chances you'll check-in by mistake credentials in plaintext to your source control system.

Credential types supported vary by service. Currently all services require username and password, except for Salesforce, in which we support OAuth credentials as well.
In the future we're planning support for storing credentials in a secured shared location.

## What is Salto's License?

Salto is available under the Apache License, version 2.0.

## Does Salto collect any telemetry data?

While you can easily opt-out of sending any data, Salto does collect by default some telemetry data.
Please see [Telemetry](telemetry.md) for more information, as well as the project's [privacy policy](https://salto.io/oss_privacy_policy.html).

## I'm missing feature X, how can I tell you about it?

We would love to get your feedback! Please see [Contributing](contributing.md) for more information.

## What are the system requirements for running Salto on my local machine?

Salto should run fine on any modern computer with a modern operating system (Windows, macOS or Linux), with at least 8GB RAM, and preferably a solid-state drive (SSD).
In addition, as Salto performs quite a few API calls to your business applications, a stable internet connection is required.

In order to represent your configuration in a way that is easy to manage and review, Salto generates many small files as part of its regular operation. Most modern machines handle this without issues - but some background processes, such as file backup, anti-virus and disk monitoring tools, may need some adjustments in order to allow these operations to run efficiently. If you’re using git or developing on a large codebase, this is likely already addressed.

## I love Salto, how can I contribute?

## What's NaCl?

NaCl stands for "Not Another Configuration Language", and is also the chemical formula of Sodium Chloride, which is more commonly known as table **salt**.

In our context, it is an [hcl](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/tree/hcl2) based declarative configuration language, with semantics purpose built to describe the configuration of business applications.

## Why did we choose Knuckles as our mascot?

![Knuckles](../bnw-face.png)

Like his fellow beavers, **Knuckles** is both an architect and a builder. A skilled artisan, his creations add value to the community he lives in and to the ecosystem as a whole. Like Knuckles, we like to dream and give birth to new ideas. We are proud to be a part of a community of builders and do our part so it can keep developing and thriving. His name has a similar ring to NaCl and, well, it just seemed an appropriate name for a beaver.
