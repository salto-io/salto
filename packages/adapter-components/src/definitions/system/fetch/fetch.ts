 * Fetch flow:
 * - Resource types to fetch are determined by the fetch query
 * - Client endpoints producing the relevant resources are called, starting from those with no "dynamic" dependencies
 *   (i.e., for which context.dependsOn is empty) - then once these resources are fetched,
 *   the dependent resources are also fetched recursively
 * - Endpoint responses produce resource fragments using the responseExtractor definitions
 * - Resource fragments are aggregated by the type + service ids
 * - Sub-resources specified via recurseInto are called once their relevant context is available
 * - Once all fragments of a resource have been fetched, the resource is created using the mergeAndTransform definition
 * - Once all resources have been generated, elements are produced
