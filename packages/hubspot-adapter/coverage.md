V* = Partially supported with limitations as described below

### Limitations

Folders management is not supported for all features.
This means that inside an environment you can not rename, delete or create Folders. You also can not move Forms/Workflows/Emails between folders.

#### Forms

* Only “Regular forms” are supported. Including “Embedded forms” and “Full-page forms”. Pop-up forms are not supported 
* Only questions connected to a Contact property are fully supported. Questions that are connected to Ticket/Company and all non-Contact entities are partially supported.
* Modifying the GDPR Settings is not supported.
* Modifying the Form’s language is not supported. 

#### Workflows

* Modifying is not supported.
* When creating a new Workflow there are extra validations compared to the UI. So copy pasting an existing Workflow and just changing the name might not work.

#### Emails

* The “Smart rules” features support is limited to Subject.
* You can’t create new smart rules through Salto. Only ones that already appear in the NaCl’s can be used (in other emails).

## Multi-environment

Multi-environment support is very limited. Some major features such as Folders structure and the ability to create/modify Records are limited and can cause unexpected behaviour.
It is currently not advised to use salto to manage multiple environments in HubSpot.
