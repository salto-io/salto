Features are included as optional by default. In order to include a required feature add the `":required"` suffix to it.
Example:
```
netsuite {
  deploy = {
    additionalDependencies = {
      include = {
        features = [
          "DEPARTMENTS", // will be added as optional
          "SUBSCRIPTIONBILLING:required", // will be added as required
        ]
      }
