// Disable salesforce logging for a few reasons:
// 1. It has a significant impact on memory consumption
// 2. It creates timers that delay the termination of the process
// 3. It uses relative paths to reference source files and thus cannot work when packed
process.env.SF_DISABLE_LOG_FILE = 'true'
// Due to an issue in the implementation of @jsforce/jsforce-node, it will emit a "console.error" if the process runs
// without a `HOME` environment variable configured.
// They have a PR to fix it, but until that issue is fixed, using this configuration works around the code path that
// leads to "console.error".
// Since we should never actually call any function that uses a connection from that library, this should not really
// affect anything.
