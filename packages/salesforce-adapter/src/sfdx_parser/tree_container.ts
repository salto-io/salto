// The following implementation is needed to support reading "non-decomposed" component types.
// A bit of background - "decomposed" types are types whose instances are part of their parent XML in metadata format
// but are split into separate files in source format (e.g - CustomObject is decomposed from a giant XML to a folder where
// fields and a lot of other types get their own files).
// "non-decomposed" types are types where this does not happen, meaning, they remain nested in their parent XML in source format.
// In the SFDX code, there is a separate code path for handling non-decomposed types which uses the "readFileSync" method of TreeContainer
// Unfortunately, the base implementation of ZipTreeContainer does not support that method, so, if we were to try and use that
// we would not be able to work with non-decomposed types.
// Hence, we add our own implementation of a ZipTreeContainer that does support "readFileSync" by leveraging the fact that we
// have access to the original contents of the zip in memory anyway in our flow
// TODO: In the future we could probably be more efficient and skip the whole transformation to a zipped buffer and instead
// implement a TreeContainer from scratch
