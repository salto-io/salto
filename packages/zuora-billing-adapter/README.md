# Zuora Billing adapter

Zuora Billing read-only adapter for salto.io

Salto helps you keep track of the main configuration entities in the Zuora Billing module, including the product catalog and rate plans, workflows, custom and standard objects, as well as settings related to accounting and billing.

We do this using the [Zuora REST API](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/).

**Known limitations:**
* Multi-entity tenants are not yet supported. Please reach out if you would like use Salto on a tenant with multiple entities.
* Some parts of the configuration may not yet be accessible via API on your tenant. If you are unable to see something that you think should be available, we are happy to help understand what needs to be enabled (with help from the Zuora support team).
* Zuora has many different feature combinations, and we have not yet covered all of them. If you see something missing and would like to make it available, contact us and we will do our best to support it.

## Connecting to your Zuora account
Salto authenticates with Zuora using [OAuth v2.0](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#section/Authentication/OAuth-v2.0). If you do not have one already, follow the steps to:
- Create [an API user role and an API user](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Tenant_Management/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users/Create_an_API_User)
- Add an [OAuth client](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Tenant_Management/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users#Create_an_OAuth_Client_for_a_User) for your API user - by going to Administration -> Manage Users -> (choose the user) -> OAuth Clients -> create (and keep the client ID and secret shown on screen)

When logging in with Salto, you will be asked to provide:
- The OAuth client ID and secret
- The subdomain for your account (can be copied from the URL in the browser - for example, for https://sandbox.na.zuora.com/ the subdomain is sandbox.na)

## E2E tests

E2E tests need real Zuora credentials to run.

### Using a specific set of credentials

Add the following environment variables to bash_profile:
```bash
export ZA_BASE_URL='XXXX'
export ZA_CLIENT_ID='XXXX'
export ZA_CLIENT_SECRET='XXXX'
```

### Using the shared credentials pool

The credentials pool can be used to run the E2E tests concurrently on multiple Zuora accounts.

The pool is used if the `ZA_` environment variables are not defined. You can also force its use by defining the environment variable `USE_CRED_POOL=1`.

#### AWS credentials for the pool

The pool uses Amazon DynamoDB, and needs read/write/list permissions for the `e2e_permissions` table.

Make sure your [AWS credentials are set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html), e.g, as environment variables:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='XXXX'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='XXXX'
```

#### Managing the pool using CLI

To add your credentials to the pool, use the `cred-store` CLI located at the `e2e_test` directory of the project:

```bash
./e2e_test/cred_store register zuora_billing 'my-credentials-id' --baseURL='https://rest.SANDBOX_SUBDOMAIN.zuora.com' --clientId='MYCLIENTID' --clientSecret='MYCLIENTSECRET'
```

Enter `--help` to see other uses for the `cred-store` utility - listing, removing and managing sets of credentials.
